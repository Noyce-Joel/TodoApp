## Todo App
This is a full stack CRUD application built using REST APIs (nextjs api routes). The app allows users to create todo lists and sort them in terms of priority.
All the data is stored in a MongoDb database; updated in real time as the user creates and edits material.
I've animated the interface to breath some life into the user experience and added OAuth for secure authentication
